## What is this?

This is the solver for Sudoku (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku>, a.k.a. Number Place).
It can solve easy Sudoku puzzles like human solving, but cannot solve complex ones. In detail, it can only solve the Sudoku puzzles that do not need to be divided by case.

## How to Use

- Make conda env by conda_requirements.txt
- Prepare a Sudoku puzzle in input.txt
- Run 'main.py input.txt'
